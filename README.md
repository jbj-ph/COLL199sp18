# COLL 199 Trinity Portfolio Program | Spring 2018

This is the main course site for COLL 199: Trinity Portfoio Program. Still a little in progress.

**Instructor**

Jason B. Jones<br>
**Phone**: 860.297.2454<br>
**E-mail**: jason.jones (at) trincoll.edu<br>
**Twitter**: <a href="http://twitter.com/jbj" target="blank">@jbj</a><br>
**Office hours**: M, F 8.15-9am, or by appointment. (I'm around a lot.)

## Course Description: 

Creating a Trinity Portfolio is a great way to reflect on your academic accomplishments, highlight the importance of your athletic and extra-curricular activities, and share your accomplishments with family, friends, professional contacts and graduate programs. It's also a way to develop some resume-worthy technical experience, demonstrate critical thinking skills and strategize future learning experiences at Trinity and beyond. Your Portfolio can also be a valuable resource when working with your advisor. Along with your transcript, your portfolio site can help you and your advisor understand what Trinity experiences are most valuable to you, and highlight areas where you may need additional coursework and extra-curricular involvement. In this course, we will help you get started with your Trinity Portfolio by working with you to create and organize content and then display that content on your own WordPress website.

## Meeting Schedule: 

The course meets once a week for 45-50 minutes. But, since it was listed as TBA, you have a couple of options. Wednesday from 12-12.50 or Thursday from 8-8.50.  You do not have to come to both!  The content will be exactly the same!! But I do need to see you each week. (If neither of these work in your schedule, don't panic-just get in touch and we'll work it out.) Class always meets in LITC 182, the Digital Scholarship Studio (the new glass-enclosed classroom right above Peter B's).

## Technology: 

You need to have a device that can access the web at every class session. Ideally this will be a computer. A tablet might work. Phones will sort of work but will make you sad.  If you don't have a laptop, get here a few minutes early and check out a Chromebook from the library.  

## Academic Accommodations:

If you need, or suspect that you need, an academic accommodation on the basis of a disability, please contact Lori Clapis in Student Accessibility Services at either lori.clapis@trincoll.edu or 860.297.4025 (or just stop downstairs!). 

## Particulars:
1.	Participation, in-class and online: 10%
2.	Actually making the portfolio: 60%
3.	Review process: 20%
4.	Peer evaluation: 10%

# Participation

We should be able to have lively class discussions and workshops. I've also assigned some very light reading each week. For the linked essays, please leave one comment in our Hypothes.is group, and respond to someone else's comment. (One comment and one reply per week, not per essay, is fine.) 

Here's how to get Hypothes.is set up:

One of the things we'll be using this semester is a tool called Hypothes.is, which is a tool allowing anyone to add comments to, or highlight, any website, and to share those comments with others.

We'll go over how to do this in class, but you'll need a link in the instructions below.

To set up hypothes.is

1. Go to https://hypothes.is 

2. Click one of the Get Started buttons

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up for an account and, if you have your own laptop with you, install the bookmarklet on a browser you use.

Once you have an account, please follow this link to join the hypothes.is group for our class: [Look in [Moodle](https://moodle.trincoll.edu/mod/page/view.php?id=309598) or email JBJ for the link]

There are no more steps! For any of the readings we'll do for class, please comment at least once and reply to someone else's comment.
