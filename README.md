## Course Description: 

Creating a Trinity Portfolio is a great way to reflect on your academic accomplishments, highlight the importance of your athletic and extra-curricular activities, and share your accomplishments with family, friends, professional contacts and graduate programs. It's also a way to develop some resume-worthy technical experience, demonstrate critical thinking skills and strategize future learning experiences at Trinity and beyond. Your Portfolio can also be a valuable resource when working with your advisor. Along with your transcript, your portfolio site can help you and your advisor understand what Trinity experiences are most valuable to you, and highlight areas where you may need additional coursework and extra-curricular involvement. In this course, we will help you get started with your Trinity Portfolio by working with you to create and organize content and then display that content on your own WordPress website.

## Meeting Schedule: 

The course meets once a week for 45-50 minutes. But, since it was listed as TBA, you have a couple of options. Wednesday from 12-12.50 or Thursday from 8-8.50.  You do not have to come to both!  The content will be exactly the same!! But I do need to see you each week. (If neither of these work in your schedule, don't panic-just get in touch and we'll work it out.) Class always meets in LITC 182, the Digital Scholarship Studio (the new glass-enclosed classroom right above Peter B's).

## Technology: 

You need to have a device that can access the web at every class session. Ideally this will be a computer. A tablet might work. Phones will sort of work but will make you sad.  If you don't have a laptop, get here a few minutes early and check out a Chromebook from the library.  

## Academic Accommodations:

If you need, or suspect that you need, an academic accommodation on the basis of a disability, please contact Lori Clapis in Student Accessibility Services at either lori.clapis@trincoll.edu or 860.297.4025 (or just stop downstairs!).
